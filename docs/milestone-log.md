# Milestone log

## 2026-10-04 — repository reset

- Previous project (Gates of CodeX, Godot/Python) removed from the working tree. Its history remains in
  this repository's other branches; local-only work was committed to `archive/pre-warfighter-local-wip`
  (not pushed). Stale worktree records pruned; none of the worktree folders existed on disk.
- New history starts on orphan branch `warfighter-campaign`.
- Deviation from plan: the workspace is this folder (inside the Steam workshop directory) at the owner's
  request, not `Documents\Codex\WarfighterCampaign`. Steam does not manage this ID's content today, but
  nothing here should be assumed safe from a Workshop re-download.

## M0 — frozen baseline and extraction: DONE

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| GOE file count / bytes | 10 / 135,224,771 — matches plan |
| GOE ZIP SHA256 | `926BEA2E…7316B` — matches plan |
| GOE `Assembly-CSharp.dll` SHA256 after extraction | `B5A9AF86…109F1` — matches plan |
| WF file count / bytes | 18,224 / 50,195,940,296 — matches plan |
| Steam build id | 25492057 — matches plan |
| Game executable version | 1.0.6.7 (`1.0.6.7-aaa36ed4d`) |
| ZIP extraction | 201 entries, every path validated inside `upstream/goe-portable` |
| Archive indexes | GOE zip, 5 WF paks (entity 138,490 entries; texture 22,021; sound 21,534; map 1,302; default 101), 11 base-game paks (gamelogic 8,969) |

Files: `tools/baseline.py`, `tools/paths.json`, `evidence/baseline.json`, `evidence/source-manifest.json`,
`evidence/archive-index-summary.json`, `evidence/provenance.json`.

Not done in M0: enabled-mods/profile capture (needs the owner to pick the profile), copies of effective
base conquest modules (planning workspace already holds them under `pl\work\goe-inspection`).

## M1 — recovered build: IN PROGRESS, gate NOT met

Done:
- Managed code decompiled with ilspycmd 9.1.0.7988: 211 files, ~33k lines, in `recovered/csharp`.
- Battle export → result → survivor import traced: `docs/battle-round-trip.md`.
- Feature-parity matrix from source: `docs/feature-parity.md`.

Blocked:
- No Unity editor is installed (plan expects 6000.4.0f1) and AssetRipper is not installed. Scenes,
  ScriptableObjects (province database, adjacency, world/supply rules, status template, map catalog, unit
  catalogs) and UI prefabs are still inside `resources.assets`, `sharedassets*.assets`, `level0/1`.
- Without those, the recovery gate (repeatable local build with working map, new/load/save, catalog UI)
  cannot be attempted.

WF spot checks against the installed files (2026-10-04):
- Roster include chain exists loose: `campaign_capture_the_flag.set` (32 B) → `roster_conquest.set` (48 B)
  → `wf_roster_conquest.inc` (587,733 B).
- Ten AI purchase lists present: fra, ger, grm, idf, pla, reb, rus, uaf, usa, usmc.
- `values.set` Warfighter matchups are strictly {usa, usmc, uaf, ger, fra, idf} versus {grm, reb, rus, pla},
  in both directions. No same-bloc pairing is allowed, which constrains campaign diplomacy (plan stage H).

Remaining risks: recovery quality of Unity 6 serialized assets; Netcode/Transport/URP package versions
must be read from the recovered project, not guessed; redistribution status of GOE code is unresolved.

Next action: install Unity 6000.4.0f1 and AssetRipper, run asset recovery into `recovered/unity`, attempt
to open and build. In parallel M2 (WF content resolver and catalogs) can start from the archive indexes.
